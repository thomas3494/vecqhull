\section{Conclusions and Future Research}

We have seen ideas from sorting can be modified to fit Quickhull as well.
We obtain a $1.5$~\textendash~$13\times$ sequentially and a 
$1.3$~\textendash~$8.6\times$ speedup in parallel. We obtain roughly $80\%$
of our architecture's bandwidth. Our implementation performs
best on an instruction set supporting SIMD compression instructions.
We can make our implementation robust with only a modest cost to perfomance.
