\section{Conclusions and Future Research}

We have seen ideas from sorting can be modified to fit Quickhull as well.
We obtain a $1.5$~\textendash~$13\times$ sequentially and a 
$1.3$~\textendash~$8.6\times$ speedup in parallel. Our implementation performs
best on an instruction set supporting SIMD compression instructions.

We obtain roughly $80\%$ of our architecture's bandwidth, so to obtain
significant improvements future work should focus on finding a convex hull
algorithm with lower bandwidth requirements. A step in this direction could
be to efficiently vectorize and parallelise the Akl-Toussaint heuristic as
described in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}.
