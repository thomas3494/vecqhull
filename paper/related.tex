\section{Related Work}

There are many algorithms for computing Convex Hulls \cite{}. The original
authors of the Quickhull algorithm provide an implementation \cite{qhull},
which works on arbitrary dimension. This and the other algorithms mentioned
are implemented in the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) 
\cite{cgal}.

We have done some preliminary testing on a laptop with a disk of $10^7$ points,
the results of which are summarized in Table~\ref{table:reference}.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \caption{Runtime in seconds for a disk of $10^7$ points}
    \label{table:reference}
    \begin{tabular}{c | c }
     Implementation & Runtime \\
     \hline \\
     PBBS & 0.31 \\
     CGAL Quickhull & 0.61 \\
     CGAL Akl-Toussaint & 0.60 \\
     CGAL Bykat & 0.73 \\
     CGAL Eddy & 0.98 \\
     CGAL Graham & 1.3 \\
     CGAL Jarvis & 208 \\
     Qhull & 1.1 \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\tkcomment{TODO: sorting stuff, accuracy}

One could consider Super Scalar Sample Sort \cite{ssss} to be to the
Akl-Toussaint heuristic as Quicksort is to Quickhull. A parallel and in-place
variant of this is called ips4o \cite{ips4o}.
