%    Finding the convex hull is a fundamental problem in computational geometry.
%    
%    A well-rounded and fast algorithm is Quickhull, a problem similar to 
%    Quicksort.
%
%    In this paper, we take a thorough look at implementing this algorithm,
%    investigating runtime, memory-usage, energy consumption, and 
%    numerical accuracy.
%
%    We also provide a novel parallel algorithm.
%
%    This results in a runtime improvement of up to $13 \times$ for a
%    sequential implementation, and up to $? \times$ for a multithreaded
%    implementation.
